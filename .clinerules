# Project Understanding Rules

When starting work on this project:

1. First, read and understand the codebase by exploring the directory structure
2. Use `tree` command excluding large directories (node_modules, etc.)
3. Read `docs/llm-context.md` to understand previous learnings about the project
4. Summarize your understanding of the project structure and purpose
5. Update `docs/llm-context.md` with new insights when completing tasks

Always maintain context about the project's architecture and purpose.
